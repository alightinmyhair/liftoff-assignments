For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
The Grocery App will enable a user to add their own grocery lists or choose an item from the Grocery Library to their grocery list. Grocery items on grocery lists will be categorized into a food group and after a user has checked off grocery items from the grocery list, they can see a percentage breakdown of the food they have purchased in a pie chart. Users will find this application helpful in organizing the users' grocery items; and insights into the what food groups the user is purchasing the most of.
### Features
1. Add grocery item: Users can input their own grocery items
2. Grocery Library: Users can choose from default grocery items
3. Grocery Classification: Users can see the items selected displayed in food groups
4. Grocery results: Users can see the results of their grocery purchases after completion of a grocery visit
### Technologies
-Java
-JavaScript
-MySQL
-Hibernate
-Thymeleaf Templates
### What I'll Have to Learn
While I have utilized the technologies above to some degree in past assignments in LC101, I will need to revisit JavaScript concepts, as I want my app to be very interactive that keeps the user feeling engaged when using the app.
