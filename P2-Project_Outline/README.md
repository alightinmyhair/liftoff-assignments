## Submission Instructions

### Overview
The Grocery App will seek to satisfy two things missing from grocery apps on the market today. This Grocery App will not only help classify grocery items into categories, giving a more organized structure when a user is grocery shopping, but it will provide insights into what food categories the user is purchasing the most and least of. 
The app will enable users to add their own Grocery Category to classify the grocery items that they will be adding to their Grocery List. While the user can add their own Grocery Item they can also choose an item from the Grocery Library. Grocery items on Grocery Lists will be categorized into a food category and after a user has checked off grocery items from the Grocery List and completed their grocery trip, they can see a breakdown of the foods that were purchased, displayed in a pie chart.
### Features
1. Grocery HomePage: The Homepage will allow returning users to login or new users to sign up. After login, the page will reroute to a Grocery List
2. Grocery Classification: A Grocery Category button will be present so a user can start adding grocery food groups
3. Grocery Item Management: Users can input their own grocery items. As the user types in the name of item, a check will be performed on the database to verify whether the grocery item is already present in the Grocery Library
4. Grocery Library: Users can choose from default grocery items, already classified into categories
5. Grocery Data: Users can see the results of their grocery purchases after completion of a grocery visit in a pie chart
### Technologies

-MongoDB
-Hibernate
-Thymeleaf Templates
### What I'll Have to Learn
While I have utilized some technologies above to a certain degree in past assignments in LC101, I will need to revisit JavaScript and Java concepts. New technologies will be MongoDB and JHipster. I decided to use MongoDB instead of SQL Server since I use SQL in my full time job and I feel well versed in the syntax. I would like to explore MongoDB to see what the benefits are and the differences between it and SQL. JHipster will also be a new technology that was introduced at the start of the Liftoff class that I would like to research further to see if it would be a good option to use in my application.
